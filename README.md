# OP07-RLC-Filter-Simulation
Simulation and practical implementation of an OP07-based RLC filter circuit. The project includes theoretical analysis, MATLAB step and impulse response plots, SPICE simulation, frequency sweep behavior around 20kHz cutoff, and physical breadboard construction with oscilloscope measurements.
